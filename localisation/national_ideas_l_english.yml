 dornish_5_desc:0 "Dornishmen prefer round metal shields, spears, short throwing spears or double-curved bows. The Dornishmen are famous for their sand steed-riding light cavalry, and use their double-curved bows skillfully from horseback. Because of the heat, they wear lighter armor than in the rest of the Seven Kingdoms made of metal disks, sometimes decorated with copper, sewn in the manner of scales on the leather. To allow themselves to fight in the burning sun of Dorne, they wear brightly colored flowing robes covering the metal parts of their armor."
 dornish_6:0 "Exotic Tradegoods"
 dornish_6_desc:0 "Dorne provides many exotic products which are uncommon in the rest of the Seven Kingdoms, in particular, citrus fruits and Dorne's own special wines.

It is composed of a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble. The wall is smooth and curving, the stones so well placed and so perfectly together that the wind can find no purchase. On the seaward side, there is a 150-foot drop below the wall into the sea. \n\nThe castle itself consists of one huge drum tower crowned with formidable battlements, so that from a distance enemies can see what appears to be a single huge, spiked fist thrusting towards the sky in defiance. The tower is so large that it comfortably contains the granary, barracks, armoury, feast hall and lord's chambers all at once. There are spells woven into the stonework. The seaward side of the castle stands upon a high white cliffs overlooking the sea, and there is a barred, watery passage through a cavern that leads beneath the castle."

Her divine parents forbade their love, but Durran and Elenei wed despite them. The gods’ wrath was terrible to behold, destroying Durran's keep on his wedding night, killing all his family and guests. Enraged, Durran declared war on the gods, who replied by hammering his kingdom with massive storms. Each time King Durran built a castle to face the sea the gods destroyed it."

Historically, the mouth of the Blackwater had been claimed by a hundred kings from the Reach, the Riverlands, and the Stormlands. \n\nThree hundred years ago, Aegon the Conqueror from House Targaryen led his army from Dragonstone and landed at the mouth of the Blackwater Rush, building his first fortress of wood and earth, the Aegonfort, on top of the highest hill. Later, when Aegon finalized his conquest, he decided to build his capital around that fort, since it was more centrally located than any other and not part of the former kingdoms, setting the king apart from his new vassals."
 crownlander_6:0 "The Kingsguard"
 crownlander_6_desc:0 "The Kingsguard, also known poetically as the White Swords or White Cloaks, are the royal bodyguards of the Iron Throne. Supposedly the finest knights in the Seven Kingdoms, they are sworn to protect their king and the royal family with their own lives, to obey his commands, and to keep his secrets. They are sworn for life and are forbidden from owning land, taking a wife, or fathering children."

 westerman_7:0 "Reyne-Tarbeck Rebellion"
 westerman_7_desc:0 "During the rule of Lord Tytos Lannister, the power of House Lannister was nominal. Tytos was held in low esteem and was largely ignored by his vassals. House Tarbeck and House Reyne eventually revolted against his rule. Tytos's son, Tywin, led the campaign against the Reyne-Tarbeck Rebellion. Houses Tarbeck and Reyne were extinguished; their respective seats at Tarbeck Hall and Castamere were razed. \n\nSince this time no house dares oppose House Lannister in the Westerlands. Because of this unity, the Westerlands are a force to be reckoned with. Tywin's own prestige was so great and his capabilities so well demonstrated that he became Hand of the King for King Aerys II Targaryen, although he later resigned from the position."
