 #----------------------------------------------------------------------
 GOT_WARTIME.1.title: "The Plight of [Root.GetName]"
 GOT_WARTIME.1.desc: "All of [Root.Owner.GetName] suffers in war, but those provinces which lie in the path of the enemy suffer worst. What appears to a soldier or commander as a convenient source of supplies is often all the common people have. The outskirts of [Root.GetCapitalName] have been plundered in this war to the point of starvation. They are now reaching out for the government to aid them in recovering, lest the suffering of [Root.Owner.GetName] drag on for years past the eventual peace."
 GOT_WARTIME.1.option.a: "Whatever is necessary, we will provide."
 GOT_WARTIME.1.option.b: "That money is better spent winning this war."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.2.title: "Cruelty of Mercenaries"
 GOT_WARTIME.2.desc: "War is seldom without brutality. Soldiers are not known for their mercy, but this war has seen some exceptionally vile behavior on part of our occupying forces. It appears that mercenaries, unsatisfied with the wages we provide them with, have resorted to robbing the civilian population. Extortion by means of terror and torture has become commonplace, [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers are reviled as well as feared and stories of their atrocities spread beyond the borders of the war."
 GOT_WARTIME.2.option.a: "We should prevent this from happening in the future."
 GOT_WARTIME.2.option.b: "Let them take what they want."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.3.title: "Mercenary Bands Raid [Root.GetName]"
 GOT_WARTIME.3.desc: "The enemy occupation of [Root.GetName] came at a great cost for its people. Whether driven by greed or desperation, soldiers of fortune working with the occupying forces plundered and terrorized local civilians in an attempt to extort money and resources."
 GOT_WARTIME.3.option.a: "Greed corrupts men's hearts..."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.4.title: "Displaced Refugees from [Root.GetName]"
 GOT_WARTIME.4.desc: "The lingering effects of the war still plague [Root.Owner.GetName]. Some areas have been destroyed to the point of becoming nearly uninhabitable, and people have been forced to move around to survive under these conditions. Some people have left [Root.GetName] entirely, settling in neighboring provinces where the war has left less scars."
 GOT_WARTIME.4.option.a: "The war may be over, but our troubles are not."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.5.title: "The Families Left Behind"
 GOT_WARTIME.5.desc: "The recent war took a heavy toll on our people. Many were called, few returned. The families of nobles and commoners alike toiled as they waited for soldiers to return home, but the war ended and they never did. Now the toiling continues, many being so preoccupied with the work to make up for the lost pair of hands that they barely have time to grieve. Of the ones who have time to think, many are increasingly thinking that we have been throwing away lives too carelessly."
 GOT_WARTIME.5.option.a: "We can ease the tax burden on the bereaved."
 GOT_WARTIME.5.option.b: "Let us be more lenient drafting for the army in the future."
 GOT_WARTIME.5.option.c: "This is the price that must be paid for our glorious nation."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.6.title: "Witchcraft"
 GOT_WARTIME.6.desc: "The people of the war-torn city of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are looking for reasons for the misfortunes that have befallen them. Fortunately, they have not found them to be related to our rulership, but unfortunately, what they have found has caused quite a stir. The prolonged effects of the war and how they seem to affect some more than others, they claim, can only be the work of those practicing witchcraft and sorcery.\n\nAccusations have been leveled generously, and there are local authorities willing to organize proper trials for these crimes. As proper as trials for magic get in [Root.GetName], anyway."
 GOT_WARTIME.6.option.a: "Allow them to proceed with the local trials."
 GOT_WARTIME.6.option.b: "$INQUISITOR$ can see to these matters in a more organized fashion."
 GOT_WARTIME.6.option.c: "Such foolish superstitions have no place in [Root.Owner.GetName]!"
 
 GOT_WARTIME.7.title: "Witch-hunt"
 GOT_WARTIME.7.desc: "Since the long-suffering people in [Root.GetName] received the blessing of the state and church to prosecute those who allegedly brought famine and disease upon them by means of witchcraft, they have made good use of it. While once only the obviously suspicious were pointed out, witches now appear to be everywhere. The crowd calls for the spilling of peasant and noble blood alike, and even some of the local clergy may not be trustworthy.\n\nThis abundance of satanic practices certainly goes a long way to explain the post-war hardships of [Root.GetName], but the mass trials that have followed are going out of hand. We might consider the possibility that some are innocent."
 GOT_WARTIME.7.option.a: "Cease this madness!"
 GOT_WARTIME.7.option.b: "Intervene on behalf of the nobles."
 GOT_WARTIME.7.option.c: "Intervene on behalf of the commoners."
 GOT_WARTIME.7.option.d: "Let them exact justice as they see fit."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.8.title: "A Witch from Foreign Lands"
 GOT_WARTIME.8.desc: "Being able to recognize witches and sorcerers with certainty is a rare gift, which we do not know on whom God will bestow. Fortunately, being able to recognize them with uncertainty based on strange or unusual behavior or successes is a very common gift with the added benefit of more consistently targeting people who are somewhat maladjusted.\n\nSometimes, however, it can be inconvenient. Locals in [Root.GetName] have recently pointed out a foreign noblewoman as a witch. Prosecuting her might cause a diplomatic incident, but not intervening might be seen as a sign of lacking faith."
 GOT_WARTIME.8.option.a: "This fear of the unfamiliar must be stopped."
 GOT_WARTIME.8.option.b: "Witches, spies, who know what they're up to?"
 
 GOT_WARTIME.9.title: "A Highly Troubling Accusation"
 GOT_WARTIME.9.desc: "Under the watchful eye of $INQUISITOR$, trials for sorcery and heresy have proceeded under relatively controlled circumstances. $INQUISITOR_CAP_ADJ$ would not be at our court if we did not trust $INQUISITORO_PRONOUN$, after all. A recent event has complicated this, however, as $INQUISITOR_ADJ$ has challenged our trust of another. $STATESMAN$$TRADER$$SPYMASTER$$DIPLOMAT$, who has aided [Root.GetName] greatly in foreign relations, has been accused of witchcraft, a testament to no one being truly unquestionable.\n\n$STATESMAN$$TRADER$$SPYMASTER$$DIPLOMAT$ claims that $INQUISITOR$ is supporting these accusations out of pure jealousy. Political drama may be behind all this, but then again, we have trusted our inquisitor so far."
 GOT_WARTIME.9.option.a: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
 GOT_WARTIME.9.option.b: "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.10.title: "The Fires of Hell"
 GOT_WARTIME.10.desc: "$INQUISITOR$ has been diligent. With the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s support, those who practice witchcraft are condemned and burned, on Earth as it is in Hell. Our merciless prosecution of these crimes has put our religious devotion beyond reproach.\n\nStill, there are moments of doubt. One day, your young heir [Root.Heir.GetName] watches the public execution of a witch for the first time. You see [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] eyes fill up with terror in the firelight, and before it's through, your child is begging for the witch to be spared. Your attempts to explain do nothing to stop the tears, and eventually you find yourself at a loss to justify this to an innocent mind. Perhaps the convicted is innocent too, and you will once burn yourself, eternally."
 GOT_WARTIME.10.option.a: "The child is right. We have been blinded by our zeal."
 GOT_WARTIME.10.option.b: "Hush child, and hope no one heard that..."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.11.title: "A Change of Character"
 GOT_WARTIME.11.desc: "After the war ended, our ardent diplomatic advisor $DIPLOMAT$ has repeatedly implored [Root.Monarch.GetName] not only to shift foreign policy to avoid future bloodshed, but even suggested that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] should change [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] priorities as a ruler.\n\n'As long as the people see their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] preparing for war, how can they do anything but blame us when war is upon them?' $DIPLOMAT$ asks. 'It is not merely what the people want. It is what this nation needs.'"
 GOT_WARTIME.11.option.a: "You are right, [Root.GetName] needs peace."
 GOT_WARTIME.11.option.b: "Forsake the spirit that called me to war? Ridiculous."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.12.title: "The Faithful in Enemy Lands"
 GOT_WARTIME.12.desc: "Many soldiers see our ongoing war as a conflict of faiths. This has led to some debate around one of our ongoing sieges, where the local population are good [Root.Religion.GetName]s. Normally, our troops would supply the siege by taking what we need from the locals, but the pious in our army think we should spare our [Root.Religion.GetName] brothers and sisters, even at the cost of the siege dragging out for longer. Which comes first among the [Root.GetAdjective], faith or war?"
 GOT_WARTIME.12.option.a: "Spare the faithful."
 GOT_WARTIME.12.option.b: "No mercy for enemies of [Root.GetName]!"
 
 GOT_WARTIME.13.title: "[Root.GetName] Betrayed by Brothers in Faith"
 GOT_WARTIME.13.desc: "When the [Root.Religion.GetName] fools of [Root.GetName] were first attacked by our enemies, they shared their faith, despite our best efforts to make them see the light. Now, having suffered the brutal onslaught of the war, they have seen just how shallow the morality of the [Root.Religion.GetName] really is. After being besieged and raided by the people they trusted, they have bitterly thrown aside their old beliefs, and swore allegiance not only to our country, but to our religion."
 GOT_WARTIME.13.option.a: "We will show them the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith has more integrity than that."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.14.title: "Unbelievers in [Root.GetName] Waver"
 GOT_WARTIME.14.desc: "While most of our nation fears the [Root.Religion.GetName] invaders, a few citizens seem to welcome them. After [Root.GetName] fell to the enemy, its inhabitants seem to have started considering if they'd be better off in a country headed by rulers of their own faith. In an effort of mitigate this betrayal, the local rulers have sent a messenger to our court, requesting promises of a more hands-off approach to religious matters in [Root.GetName]. Otherwise, the enemy may already have a hold on the province."
 GOT_WARTIME.14.option.a: "We will reward loyalty with respect."
 GOT_WARTIME.14.option.b: "We will not accept disloyalty."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.15.title: "[Root.Religion.GetName] Defectors"
 GOT_WARTIME.15.desc: "The wise and spiritually enlightened people of [From.GetName] have found, after we occupied their land, that they might benefit from joining us. After all, [From.Owner.GetName] is a [From.Owner.Religion.GetName] country, with little understanding of their ways. If the war goes well, this will certainly help."
 GOT_WARTIME.15.option.a: "We may be able to accommodate them..."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.16.title: "[Root.Religion.GetName] of [Root.GetName] Betray Us!"
 GOT_WARTIME.16.desc: "Our war against the [Root.Religion.GetName] has not gone unnoticed by their local supporters. In [Root.GetName], traitors who hold faith before country have taken the opportunity to rise up and attack us, perhaps hoping to aid the enemy or encourage other [Root.Religion.GetName] nations to join the war."
 GOT_WARTIME.16.option.a: "Faith determines the path of all, even the wicked."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.17.title: "Struggle Without, Struggle Within"
 GOT_WARTIME.17.desc: "Sometimes, we see conflicts on the international stage mirrored within our own borders. Today, we received news that our war with the [Root.Religion.GetName]s has brought about a religious conflict in [Root.GetName], where the [Root.Religion.GetName] and [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faiths exist side by side. People who used to be neighbors and friends are attacking each other over what they perceive as the differences between us and our adversaries."
 GOT_WARTIME.17.option.a: "Like the war, this conflict must take its course."
 GOT_WARTIME.17.option.b: "Unite against the true enemy! You are all [Root.Owner.GetAdjective]!"
 
 GOT_WARTIME.18.title: "Country Before Faith"
 GOT_WARTIME.18.desc: "Our relation to the religious dissidents in [Root.GetName] has varied, but at least some of the local [Root.Religion.GetName] citizens seem to appreciate our leadership. 'Seem to' may be a key phrase in the situation, because they have recently approached us with an offer to use their religious ties in one of our rival countries to strengthen our international spy network. Provided that they can be relied upon, they could provide a rare and valuable asset..."
 GOT_WARTIME.18.option.a: "We will trust them to remain loyal to us."
 GOT_WARTIME.18.option.b: "There is no need for such underhanded tactics... or risks."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.19.title: "Warriors of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Faith"
 GOT_WARTIME.19.desc: "The more zealous among the [Root.Religion.GetName] of [Root.GetName] have long kept watch at the border, suspicious of the motives of the unbelievers on the other side. Now, they find their suspicions confirmed by the open declaration of war. Prepared and willing to give their lives for the [Root.Religion.GetName] cause, their local militia has joined our forces in the battle against the invading army."
 GOT_WARTIME.19.option.a: "Forward, sentinels of the truth!"

This is often the only way for soldiers to survive in wartime as payments from the [Root.GovernmentName] treasury can rarely be brought in a timely manner to the men. In fact, by paying retroactively many also avoid the strain of paying for the fallen.\nAs [From.GetCapitalName] fell it was therefore expected that our soldiers be allowed to loot the city to enrich themselves. What was less expected was the total and utter destruction of the city that took place. Refusing to follow orders our men descended upon the helpless burghers, doing despicable things and ruining the area for a long time to come."

As the season for salary payment draws nearer it is becoming abundantly clear that we will not be able to pay all troops as there is simply no way for the money to get to them on time. Our generals blame constant enemy raids on the baggage train and insist they planned everything in detail, but the problem is now [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s to solve.\nIf we only pay a fraction of our troops many will no doubt desert.\nWe could also choose to pay none of them and tell them to live off the land, but that would likely devastate the entire area."

 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.9.title: "Private Contractors"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.9.desc: "Due to lack of permanent structures many armies rely on private contractors to provide everything from equipment to entire regiments. Usually these entrepreneurs receive a sum in advance that they can then use to procure what the army needs on short notice. This often works well to meet the swiftly changing needs of our troops during campaigns, but there are those that would take advantage of the system.\nAs our armies in [enemy_country.GetName] advance deeper into enemy territory there are increasing reports of corruption and unwarranted cooperation between our logistical officers and local entrepreneurs. If we are to maintain efficiency we must root out these practices but in the short run we will risk disrupting the system even more by fighting the corruption."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.9.option.a: "Root out the rot!"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.9.option.b: "We will have to let it be."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.10.title: "An Army Career"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.10.desc: "With the growth of our professional army, new career opportunities abound for those with ability and ambition. The old nobles, however, still expect to be awarded all the most valuable commissions out of tradition and the centuries during which their lineages have served the [Root.GetStateForm] faithfully.\nSome of our higher officers are now imploring us to open more opportunities for able men to rise in the ranks, while others oppose this vehemently and maintain that there are qualities only blood can assure."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.10.option.a: "We must safeguard the ancient traditions of our officer corps."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.10.option.b: "We can make room for newcomers in the higher parts of the hierarchy."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.11.title: "Esprit de Corps"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.11.desc: "The strain, that the military lifestyle puts the men who serve under, can under good circumstances lead to the development of a spirit of belonging and cooperation that greatly strengthens the armed forces. During the recent conflict with [enemy_country.GetName] we have seen clear signs that our troops are working better together and that they have formed strong bonds of loyalty and duty to the [Root.GetName] [Root.GetStateForm] that would have seemed hard to imagine just a few years ago."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.11.option.a: "This is what separates the [Root.GetAdjective] troops from all other."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.12.title: "Lack of Officers"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.12.desc: "In order to keep a sizable professional army efficient a sufficient number of trained officers are required to carry out the orders and will of the [Root.GetStateForm]. However, the increased demand on quality leadership is not matched by the number of officers on our rolls.\nWith increased demands on quality new officers also take longer to train and are harder to recruit."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.12.option.a: "Shorten the training."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.12.option.b: "Increase recruitment."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.13.title: "Local Militias"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.13.desc: "Many military duties are not performed by the professional armies of the [Root.GetStateForm] but rather by local militias based around the cities, castles and forts in the various parts of our country. These militias often know the local area well and provide very good value for money as garrisons, scouts and gatherers of intelligence but their quality as regular troops are very varied to say the least.\nIt has been suggested that we send professional soldiers to at least instruct all militias in the country and that we rely less on them when conducting operations in many areas. This would, according to our generals, lead to an increase in quality and make us less vulnerable to things we cannot control. It would, however, also most likely mean dismissing a great number of our reserve troops."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.13.option.a: "We need the militias."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.13.option.b: "Let us not rely on local abilities."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.14.title: "Fires of Industry"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.14.desc: "The growing needs of our professional army has had a profound effect on the local business in [Root.GetCapitalName]. The manufactories in and around the city can hardly keep up with rising demand and both investors and workers are now flocking from all over our country to [Root.GetName] to expand the business."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.14.option.a: "The foundries of [Root.GetCapitalName] shall supply the nation!"
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.15.title: "Growth of Regimental Towns"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.15.desc: "As the army becomes a way to earn a livelihood for an increasing number of our subjects, the cities that house the army installations and barracks are starting to grow under the supervision of army engineers and renovators. In [Root.GetName] the growth of [Root.GetCapitalName] has come to benefit the entire province."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.15.option.a: "Great."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.16.title: "Treason against [Root.GetName]"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.16.desc: "Recruitment is out of necessity something that has to be a somewhat decentralized affair. Often it will be entrusted to nobles in the capital, and then they are responsible to turn up a set number of men in the various provinces under our control.\nThis is a system that to some extent relies on trust as the central government is not involved in the details of countryside mustering, and the only form of control we have are the, often sporadic, inspections the army itself conducts. One such inspection in [cheating_rolls.GetName] has unearthed quite a local scandal. The rolls we have for the area is full of fictional names and nobody seems to know what we could actually muster from the region."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.16.option.a: "This is unfortunate."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.16.option.b: "We must punish the perpetrator and conduct our own survey."

 GOT_YITI_EMPIRE.1.desc:1 "With the fall of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] the last remnants of the Empire of Yi Ti have been crushed. The Emperorship and the ancient Yitish administration are now clearly seen as defunct concepts and the scholar gentry as a class will have to evolve into something else or perish.\nThough the memory of the Empire will live for some time the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] will forever be remembered as the destroyers of the last [From.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 GOT_YITI_EMPIRE.1.option.a: "Ok."
 
 GOT_YITI_EMPIRE.2.title: "Divinity for our Empire"
 GOT_YITI_EMPIRE.2.desc: "By assuming the mantle of Imperial Yi Ti we have taken a step into an ancient tradition. [Root.GetName] has inherited a number of institutions that are closely associated with the Yitish belief in the Lion of the Night.\nAs the new Empire of Yi Ti it is up to us to which degree we wish to integrate this ideology with our own, but embracing Yitish philosophy would likely both help us rule the vast empire we now claim and strengthen our rule in the mind of the public."
 GOT_YITI_EMPIRE.2.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is the [Root.GetTributaryOverlord]!"
 GOT_YITI_EMPIRE.2.b: "We will not dishonor the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith of our own ancestors!"

 GOT_YITI_EMPIRE.3.desc: "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have increasingly come to resent the new Yitish customs we have been introducing throughout our realm, from the court to the lowliest provincial official. Due to this growing distrust of the alien impositions on our old traditions and norms some even openly question our right to rule."

 GOT_CORRUPTION.1.title: "The Honest Merchants of [Root.GetName]"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.1.desc: "While many traders are known for cheating countrymen and foreigners alike, lying about the quality of goods and making fraudulent promises, [Root.GetAdjective] merchants are well known to be trustworthy, if competitive. Although they may sometimes cut deals that benefit themselves and not their trade partners, they rarely lie or take bribes. This has made us the first choice of traders around the world."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.1.option.a: "Why would we lie when we have the best offers?"
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.2.title: "Trust Your Neighbor"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.2.desc: "Although citizens are encouraged to show trust and good faith in their exchanges, the reality in many nations is that it's a risk people cannot afford to take. This, however, is not the case in [Root.GetName]. We have successfully stamped out corruption on so many levels in society, people not only trust officials to do their jobs without the extra help of a bribe but they also trust each other more in general exchanges. This general belief in the honesty of others is the very thread from which the fabric of society is woven, and our country is a shining example of it."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.2.option.a: "As stipulated in [Root.Religion.GetName] teachings."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.3.title: "Rigorous Maesters"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.3.desc: "Citadel institutions are not immune to corruption, and the profits that can be made by abusing positions of great influence can stand in the way of creating a good environment for research. However, [Root.GetAdjective] maesters are largely above this, focusing on genuine intellectual achievements above titles and financial contributions. The lack of corruption in society allows us to explore and invent without being impeded by selfish interests."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.3.option.a: "The search for knowledge must be valued in itself."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.4.title: "An Honorable People"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.4.desc: "Few are the countries in the world who do not claim to value honor and justice, but even fewer are the countries who actually live up to these ideals. However, the lack of large-scale and everyday corruption in [Root.GetName] has made it one of these rare places where principles matter over personal gain. Even abroad, [Root.GetAdjective] expatriates are sought-after for positions of trust, as our people are known for adherence to duty and rejecting attempted bribes. Who else can claim to live up to these ideals?"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.4.option.a: "Few indeed."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.5.title: "Incorruptible"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.5.desc: "Not everyone who aids the enemy knows the true nature of their transgression. Spies may be loyal to a foreign house, but many of their information sources are people who are simply paid well for telling secrets they shouldn't, without understanding who makes use of them. However, in [Root.GetName], corruption has been all but extinguished. Spies who recently tried to compromise our administration through bribery and extortion have found themselves reported instead of aided by our officials, and are now at our mercy."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.5.option.a: "Death to spies!"
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.6.title: "Corrupt Taxmen"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.6.desc: "Those who handle large sums of money have always been tempted to claim more than their share of it, and tax collectors are no exception. However, while money getting lost along the way may be a price we can afford to pay, affluent citizens have now found that they can avoid some taxes altogether by paying large bribes to taxmen instead. Currently this seems to be a scheme supported by some of the older collectors trying to retire comfortably. While it is costly, we might be able to avoid spending time and effort on a detailed investigation and just wait it out."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.6.option.a: "Investigate and replace them immediately."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.6.option.b: "Let them retire, they've served us well in the past."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.7.title: "Corrupt Advisor"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.7.desc: "[Root.GetName] may be plagued by corruption, but we try to ensure that those closest to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can be trusted, at the very least. Try and fail, it seems, since one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors was recently caught taking large bribes from people already wielding great influence in our country to provide the government with advice slanted to advance their interests. How shall we respond to this betrayal?"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.7.option.a: "Publicly expose these lies and prepare an execution."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.7.option.b: "Arrange for a quiet retirement in house arrest."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.7.option.c: "A reprimand. Biased advice is still advice."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.8.title: "Wily Smugglers"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.8.desc: "Smuggling is an activity even the most simple-minded can decide to pursue - the only difference is that they get caught. More worrying are those with genuine talent in knowing who to bribe and what lies to tell to elude capture, and as smuggling becomes more profitable, these tend to grow in numbers.\n\nWe have been on the trail of a particularly clever band of smugglers recently, and the network of deceit they have managed to create to continue their operations continues to surprise us. How should we go about resolving this?"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.8.option.a: "Send our best men to track down their collaborators."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.8.option.b: "Send an agent to recruit them as spies."

 GOT_CORRUPTION.9.title: "[culture_province.Culture.GetName] Community Distrusts Us"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.9.desc: "[Root.GetName] may not house the most egregious liars and traitors in the world, but compared to some other countries, our people do tend to be a bit more easily bribed into abusing their authority. Most of the [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] population accepts the difficulties and, to the dishonest, occasional benefits this brings.\n\nThe [culture_province.Culture.GetName] people see things differently. They lament this state of things as a consequence of letting the easily corrupted [Root.Culture.GetName] people rule the nation, claiming that the country ruled by their own people doesn't suffer the same fate. Some of them are suggesting that they would be better off seceding."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.9.option.a: "Apologize for our failure and promise to improve."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.9.option.b: "Reject this as uneducated prejudice."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.10.title: "Corrupt Ambassador"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.10.desc: "Our representatives to other countries should represent our very best people, but unfortunately, this is not always the case. Sometimes people are given posts as ambassadors because the administration wants them far away, and at worst, there is good reason for this.\n\nAs it turns out, one such ambassador has spent his well-paid exile further enriching himself with bribes. While this is not exactly improving our reputation with the locals, he has maintained important connections here at home and will not be dismissed without causing some trouble."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.10.option.a: "He has caused more trouble where he is. Get rid of him."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.10.option.b: "They'll have to get used to it."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.11.title: "[trade_goods_province.GetTradeGoodsName] 'Disappearing'"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.11.desc:1 "With corruption ever on the rise in [Root.GetName], an increasing amount of [trade_goods_province.GetTradeGoodsName] has been disappearing from our legitimate trade networks onto the black market. While some blame too restrictive regulations and tariffs, part of the problem is clearly that these crimes are simply too easy to get away with. When silence is easily bought, secrets are easy to keep, and those secrets are growing more and more costly for [Root.GetName]."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.11.option.a: "We must regain control of the [trade_goods_province.GetTradeGoodsName] market."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.12.title: "Corrupt Generals"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.12.desc: "Military experience and expertise should be the main, if not only, factors influencing who rises through the ranks of the [Root.GetAdjective] army. As our society grew more and more corrupt, practices drew further and further away from this ideal. The reality today is that a position as general carries a lot of prestige, and those with money or connections are more than willing to use them to secure such a position. With the existing leadership being easily influenced with these tools, they can.\n\nFrom time to time, someone may rise through the ranks who have actually earned their title, but many of the finest minds in strategic matters will never have a chance to lend their skills to us."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.12.option.a: "Such an unjust world."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.13.title: "Corrupt Admirals"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.13.desc: "Those who command our ships in battle or are sent to explore lands to be claimed by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should be chosen from the bravest and wisest in our navy. This is not the case today. From their very first day on a ship, sailors see money illicitly changing hands and protocol being broken as a matter of course, and quickly learn that both the letter and the spirit of the law carry little weight in [Root.GetName] when silver is put on the other pan of the scales.\n\nThose who do not learn quickly make enemies. To advance through the ranks of the [Root.GetAdjective] navy, you need to learn to play this system, and those who rise to the top are rarely those we wished would be there."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.13.option.a: "No wonder we have mutinies."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.14.title: "Foreign Merchants Distrust Us"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.14.desc: "Every trader tries to cut a deal that will be to their benefit, and many are willing to bend the truth a little to succeed. While this is expected, merchants from [Root.GetName] have a reputation abroad that goes beyond this into outright lies and fraud. The corruption which has become a part of how we do business can be shocking to outsiders, which has led to traders worldwide choosing to avoid us when possible.\n\nIt's too late to do anything about our present image, as the damage is already done, but perhaps we can stop this from reoccurring if we stamp out the casual corruption in our society."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.14.option.a: "We're not dishonest, just pragmatic!"
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.15.title: "Nobility Breaking Down"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.15.desc: "A corrupt nobility operates less to sustain itself and more to sustain its members. Consequently, as it begins to fall apart, the immediate reaction of most nobles is not to save what they all stand to lose, but to grab what they can while it lasts.\n\n[Root.GetName] may not be on its way to a complete collapse, but the severe corruption reaching all the way from the lowest clerk to those closest to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has corroded several crucial functions of the ralm, leading to a widespread destabilization of the country. This has been a long time coming and we all pay the price."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.15.option.a: "This cannot be allowed to continue."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.16.title: "Mercenaries Extorting Locals"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.16.desc: "During wartime, soldiers of fortune often find ways to make it home with a bit more than they are paid by raiding the land where they are sent to fight. Normally, this is not a problem for us when they are sent abroad to terrorize our enemies, but sometimes this habit is hard to break, even during peacetime. Some farmers and travelers in [Root.GetName] have complained that mercenaries stationed here have been robbing and extorting them, despite - or perhaps because of - the fact that there isn't even a war ongoing.\n\nMeddling in the ranks of mercenaries, even ones that we hired, is always a difficult matter. Their accusers are unlikely to take the matter further if we let it slide, but the question remains how our society will change if we allow it to continue."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.16.option.a: "Purge the mercenary ranks of such thugs."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.16.option.b: "It's part of the price our country pays for their service."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.17.title: "Incompetent Administrator"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.17.desc: "Matters of royal organization have never been [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s strong suit. What a good leader does to compensate for such a known weakness is to delegate and this is exactly what our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has done, but the people who have handled administration in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stead have proven to be more competent than honest. The nobility runs well enough, but tends to slowly shift its priorities towards matters which the benefactors of these irreplaceable nobles find to be of importance.\n\nWith [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] unable to fully grasp the intricacies of the matters in question, the guilty parties cannot easily be seen or removed from office. For now, we'll simply have to suffer the consequences."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.17.option.a: "Unfortunate that skill and honor do not always go hand in hand."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.18.title: "Overextension Exploited"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.18.desc: "The rapid expansion of the [Root.GetAdjective] borders is most fortunate, but brings with it new administrative challenges. As every person familiar with the optimistic language knows, "challenges" is the sweeter-tasting word for "problems". Our country has not fully adjusted to its new extent yet, and people who have noticed the confusion and poorly enforced law in these new acquisitions are reaping the benefits.\n\nThis lawlessness may eventually pass, but the temporary administrations appear to have built an unstable foundation for the future. It will take time and money to rid our society from the distrust forming in the present situation."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.18.option.a: "We'll have to adapt as best we can."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.19.title: "$TRADER$ Has Corrupt Connections"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.19.desc: "We try to keep our administration free of dishonest individuals, but we cannot always account for the friends and contacts which got them to where they are. $TRADER$ has unfortunately turned out to be a good example of the problems that follow from this, being skilled and personable but somewhat gullible in $TRADER_POSS_PRONOUN$ choice of associates.\n\nRecent investigations have revealed that much of our well-built trade network relies on bribes, smuggling, and other dubious activities to reach its current level of efficiency. $TRADER$ claims to have known nothing of this, which is likely true. Nevertheless, if we decide to expose and end this, the responsibility will be $TRADER_POSS_PRONOUN$ to take."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.19.option.a: "Failure to see through lies is also a failure."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.19.option.b: "If it works, it works."
 
 GOT_CORRUPTION.20.title: "Bribes Growing More Accepted"
 GOT_CORRUPTION.20.desc: "'What is the difference between an honest man and a fool? The fool doesn't know he is being swindled.'\n\nSo goes an increasingly common saying in [Root.GetName], the spirit of which is proven through a more sinister change in the social fabric. Bribes are beginning to be seen as a natural consequence of the market, where any action carries a price. Those who refuse to take bribes are viewed as precisely what the saying suggests: fools. Worse than fools, since they are deliberately refusing money that could be theirs. The consequence of this cynicism is that any form of power truly corrupts, and no one who believes it is immune. Not even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 GOT_CORRUPTION.20.option.a: "It's still just a saying."
