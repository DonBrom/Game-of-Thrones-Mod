 GOT_WARTIME.1.title: "The Plight of [Root.GetName]"
 GOT_WARTIME.1.desc: "All of [Root.Owner.GetName] suffers in war, but those provinces which lie in the path of the enemy suffer worst. What appears to a soldier or commander as a convenient source of supplies is often all the common people have. The outskirts of [Root.GetCapitalName] have been plundered in this war to the point of starvation. They are now reaching out for the government to aid them in recovering, lest the suffering of [Root.Owner.GetName] drag on for years past the eventual peace."
 GOT_WARTIME.1.option.a: "Whatever is necessary, we will provide."
 GOT_WARTIME.1.option.b: "That money is better spent winning this war."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.2.title: "Cruelty of Mercenaries"
 GOT_WARTIME.2.desc: "War is seldom without brutality. Soldiers are not known for their mercy, but this war has seen some exceptionally vile behavior on part of our occupying forces. It appears that mercenaries, unsatisfied with the wages we provide them with, have resorted to robbing the civilian population. Extortion by means of terror and torture has become commonplace, [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers are reviled as well as feared and stories of their atrocities spread beyond the borders of the war."
 GOT_WARTIME.2.option.a: "We should prevent this from happening in the future."
 GOT_WARTIME.2.option.b: "Let them take what they want."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.3.title: "Mercenary Bands Raid [Root.GetName]"
 GOT_WARTIME.3.desc: "The enemy occupation of [Root.GetName] came at a great cost for its people. Whether driven by greed or desperation, soldiers of fortune working with the occupying forces plundered and terrorized local civilians in an attempt to extort money and resources."
 GOT_WARTIME.3.option.a: "Greed corrupts men's hearts..."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.4.title: "Displaced Refugees from [Root.GetName]"
 GOT_WARTIME.4.desc: "The lingering effects of the war still plague [Root.Owner.GetName]. Some areas have been destroyed to the point of becoming nearly uninhabitable, and people have been forced to move around to survive under these conditions. Some people have left [Root.GetName] entirely, settling in neighboring provinces where the war has left less scars."
 GOT_WARTIME.4.option.a: "The war may be over, but our troubles are not."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.5.title: "The Families Left Behind"
 GOT_WARTIME.5.desc: "The recent war took a heavy toll on our people. Many were called, few returned. The families of nobles and commoners alike toiled as they waited for soldiers to return home, but the war ended and they never did. Now the toiling continues, many being so preoccupied with the work to make up for the lost pair of hands that they barely have time to grieve. Of the ones who have time to think, many are increasingly thinking that we have been throwing away lives too carelessly."
 GOT_WARTIME.5.option.a: "We can ease the tax burden on the bereaved."
 GOT_WARTIME.5.option.b: "Let us be more lenient drafting for the army in the future."
 GOT_WARTIME.5.option.c: "This is the price that must be paid for our glorious nation."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.6.title: "Witchcraft"
 GOT_WARTIME.6.desc: "The people of the war-torn city of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are looking for reasons for the misfortunes that have befallen them. Fortunately, they have not found them to be related to our rulership, but unfortunately, what they have found has caused quite a stir. The prolonged effects of the war and how they seem to affect some more than others, they claim, can only be the work of those practicing witchcraft and sorcery.\n\nAccusations have been leveled generously, and there are local authorities willing to organize proper trials for these crimes. As proper as trials for magic get in [Root.GetName], anyway."
 GOT_WARTIME.6.option.a: "Allow them to proceed with the local trials."
 GOT_WARTIME.6.option.b: "$INQUISITOR$ can see to these matters in a more organized fashion."
 GOT_WARTIME.6.option.c: "Such foolish superstitions have no place in [Root.Owner.GetName]!"
 
 GOT_WARTIME.7.title: "Witch-hunt"
 GOT_WARTIME.7.desc: "Since the long-suffering people in [Root.GetName] received the blessing of the state and church to prosecute those who allegedly brought famine and disease upon them by means of witchcraft, they have made good use of it. While once only the obviously suspicious were pointed out, witches now appear to be everywhere. The crowd calls for the spilling of peasant and noble blood alike, and even some of the local clergy may not be trustworthy.\n\nThis abundance of satanic practices certainly goes a long way to explain the post-war hardships of [Root.GetName], but the mass trials that have followed are going out of hand. We might consider the possibility that some are innocent."
 GOT_WARTIME.7.option.a: "Cease this madness!"
 GOT_WARTIME.7.option.b: "Intervene on behalf of the nobles."
 GOT_WARTIME.7.option.c: "Intervene on behalf of the commoners."
 GOT_WARTIME.7.option.desc: "Let them exact justice as they see fit."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.8.title: "A Witch from Foreign Lands"
 GOT_WARTIME.8.desc: "Being able to recognize witches and sorcerers with certainty is a rare gift, which we do not know on whom God will bestow. Fortunately, being able to recognize them with uncertainty based on strange or unusual behavior or successes is a very common gift with the added benefit of more consistently targeting people who are somewhat maladjusted.\n\nSometimes, however, it can be inconvenient. Locals in [Root.GetName] have recently pointed out a foreign noblewoman as a witch. Prosecuting her might cause a diplomatic incident, but not intervening might be seen as a sign of lacking faith."
 GOT_WARTIME.8.option.a: "This fear of the unfamiliar must be stopped."
 GOT_WARTIME.8.option.b: "Witches, spies, who know what they're up to?"
 
 GOT_WARTIME.9.title: "A Highly Troubling Accusation"
 GOT_WARTIME.9.desc: "Under the watchful eye of $INQUISITOR$, trials for sorcery and heresy have proceeded under relatively controlled circumstances. $INQUISITOR_CAP_ADJ$ would not be at our court if we did not trust $INQUISITORO_PRONOUN$, after all. A recent event has complicated this, however, as $INQUISITOR_ADJ$ has challenged our trust of another. $STATESMAN$$TRADER$$SPYMASTER$$DIPLOMAT$, who has aided [Root.GetName] greatly in foreign relations, has been accused of witchcraft, a testament to no one being truly unquestionable.\n\n$STATESMAN$$TRADER$$SPYMASTER$$DIPLOMAT$ claims that $INQUISITOR$ is supporting these accusations out of pure jealousy. Political drama may be behind all this, but then again, we have trusted our inquisitor so far."
 GOT_WARTIME.9.option.a: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
 GOT_WARTIME.9.option.b: "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.10.title: "The Fires of Hell"
 GOT_WARTIME.10.desc: "$INQUISITOR$ has been diligent. With the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s support, those who practice witchcraft are condemned and burned, on Earth as it is in Hell. Our merciless prosecution of these crimes has put our religious devotion beyond reproach.\n\nStill, there are moments of doubt. One day, your young heir [Root.Heir.GetName] watches the public execution of a witch for the first time. You see [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] eyes fill up with terror in the firelight, and before it's through, your child is begging for the witch to be spared. Your attempts to explain do nothing to stop the tears, and eventually you find yourself at a loss to justify this to an innocent mind. Perhaps the convicted is innocent too, and you will once burn yourself, eternally."
 GOT_WARTIME.10.option.a: "The child is right. We have been blinded by our zeal."
 GOT_WARTIME.10.option.b: "Hush child, and hope no one heard that..."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.11.title: "A Change of Character"
 GOT_WARTIME.11.desc: "After the war ended, our ardent diplomatic advisor $DIPLOMAT$ has repeatedly implored [Root.Monarch.GetName] not only to shift foreign policy to avoid future bloodshed, but even suggested that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] should change [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] priorities as a ruler.\n\n'As long as the people see their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] preparing for war, how can they do anything but blame us when war is upon them?' $DIPLOMAT$ asks. 'It is not merely what the people want. It is what this nation needs.'"
 GOT_WARTIME.11.option.a: "You are right, [Root.GetName] needs peace."
 GOT_WARTIME.11.option.b: "Forsake the spirit that called me to war? Ridiculous."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.12.title: "The Faithful in Enemy Lands"
 GOT_WARTIME.12.desc: "Many soldiers see our ongoing war as a conflict of faiths. This has led to some debate around one of our ongoing sieges, where the local population are good [Root.Religion.GetName]s. Normally, our troops would supply the siege by taking what we need from the locals, but the pious in our army think we should spare our [Root.Religion.GetName] brothers and sisters, even at the cost of the siege dragging out for longer. Which comes first among the [Root.GetAdjective], faith or war?"
 GOT_WARTIME.12.option.a: "Spare the faithful."
 GOT_WARTIME.12.option.b: "No mercy for enemies of [Root.GetName]!"
 
 GOT_WARTIME.13.title: "[Root.GetName] Betrayed by Brothers in Faith"
 GOT_WARTIME.13.desc: "When the [Root.Religion.GetName] fools of [Root.GetName] were first attacked by our enemies, they shared their faith, despite our best efforts to make them see the light. Now, having suffered the brutal onslaught of the war, they have seen just how shallow the morality of the [Root.Religion.GetName] really is. After being besieged and raided by the people they trusted, they have bitterly thrown aside their old beliefs, and swore allegiance not only to our country, but to our religion."
 GOT_WARTIME.13.option.a: "We will show them the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith has more integrity than that."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.14.title: "Unbelievers in [Root.GetName] Waver"
 GOT_WARTIME.14.desc: "While most of our nation fears the [Root.Religion.GetName] invaders, a few citizens seem to welcome them. After [Root.GetName] fell to the enemy, its inhabitants seem to have started considering if they'd be better off in a country headed by rulers of their own faith. In an effort of mitigate this betrayal, the local rulers have sent a messenger to our court, requesting promises of a more hands-off approach to religious matters in [Root.GetName]. Otherwise, the enemy may already have a hold on the province."
 GOT_WARTIME.14.option.a: "We will reward loyalty with respect."
 GOT_WARTIME.14.option.b: "We will not accept disloyalty."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.15.title: "[Root.Religion.GetName] Defectors"
 GOT_WARTIME.15.desc: "The wise and spiritually enlightened people of [From.GetName] have found, after we occupied their land, that they might benefit from joining us. After all, [From.Owner.GetName] is a [From.Owner.Religion.GetName] country, with little understanding of their ways. If the war goes well, this will certainly help."
 GOT_WARTIME.15.option.a: "We may be able to accommodate them..."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.16.title: "[Root.Religion.GetName] of [Root.GetName] Betray Us!"
 GOT_WARTIME.16.desc: "Our war against the [Root.Religion.GetName] has not gone unnoticed by their local supporters. In [Root.GetName], traitors who hold faith before country have taken the opportunity to rise up and attack us, perhaps hoping to aid the enemy or encourage other [Root.Religion.GetName] nations to join the war."
 GOT_WARTIME.16.option.a: "Faith determines the path of all, even the wicked."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.17.title: "Struggle Without, Struggle Within"
 GOT_WARTIME.17.desc: "Sometimes, we see conflicts on the international stage mirrored within our own borders. Today, we received news that our war with the [Root.Religion.GetName]s has brought about a religious conflict in [Root.GetName], where the [Root.Religion.GetName] and [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faiths exist side by side. People who used to be neighbors and friends are attacking each other over what they perceive as the differences between us and our adversaries."
 GOT_WARTIME.17.option.a: "Like the war, this conflict must take its course."
 GOT_WARTIME.17.option.b: "Unite against the true enemy! You are all [Root.Owner.GetAdjective]!"
 
 GOT_WARTIME.18.title: "Country Before Faith"
 GOT_WARTIME.18.desc: "Our relation to the religious dissidents in [Root.GetName] has varied, but at least some of the local [Root.Religion.GetName] citizens seem to appreciate our leadership. 'Seem to' may be a key phrase in the situation, because they have recently approached us with an offer to use their religious ties in one of our rival countries to strengthen our international spy network. Provided that they can be relied upon, they could provide a rare and valuable asset..."
 GOT_WARTIME.18.option.a: "We will trust them to remain loyal to us."
 GOT_WARTIME.18.option.b: "There is no need for such underhanded tactics... or risks."
 
 GOT_WARTIME.19.title: "Warriors of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Faith"
 GOT_WARTIME.19.desc: "The more zealous among the [Root.Religion.GetName] of [Root.GetName] have long kept watch at the border, suspicious of the motives of the unbelievers on the other side. Now, they find their suspicions confirmed by the open declaration of war. Prepared and willing to give their lives for the [Root.Religion.GetName] cause, their local militia has joined our forces in the battle against the invading army."
 GOT_WARTIME.19.option.a: "Forward, sentinels of the truth!"

 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.1.desc: "Traditionally advancing armies have been expected to supply themselves from what they can plunder in the area they move through. This is often the only way for soldiers to survive in wartime as payments from the [Root.GovernmentName] treasury can rarely be brought in a timely manner to the men. In fact, by paying retroactively many also avoid the strain of paying for the fallen.\nAs [From.GetCapitalName] fell it was therefore expected that our soldiers be allowed to loot the city to enrich themselves. What was less expected was the total and utter destruction of the city that took place. Refusing to follow orders our men descended upon the helpless burghers, doing despicable things and ruining the area for a long time to come."

 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.4.desc: "The campaign in [enemy_country.GetName] has run into some severe logistical problems. As the season for salary payment draws nearer it is becoming abundantly clear that we will not be able to pay all troops as there is simply no way for the money to get to them on time. Our generals blame constant enemy raids on the baggage train and insist they planned everything in detail, but the problem is now [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s to solve.\nIf we only pay a fraction of our troops many will no doubt desert.\nWe could also choose to pay none of them and tell them to live off the land, but that would likely devastate the entire area."

 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.9.title: "Private Contractors"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.9.desc: "Due to lack of permanent structures many armies rely on private contractors to provide everything from equipment to entire regiments. Usually these entrepreneurs receive a sum in advance that they can then use to procure what the army needs on short notice. This often works well to meet the swiftly changing needs of our troops during campaigns, but there are those that would take advantage of the system.\nAs our armies in [enemy_country.GetName] advance deeper into enemy territory there are increasing reports of corruption and unwarranted cooperation between our logistical officers and local entrepreneurs. If we are to maintain efficiency we must root out these practices but in the short run we will risk disrupting the system even more by fighting the corruption."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.9.option.a: "Root out the rot!"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.9.option.b: "We will have to let it be."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.10.title: "An Army Career"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.10.desc: "With the growth of our professional army, new career opportunities abound for those with ability and ambition. The old [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments], however, still expect to be awarded all the most valuable commissions out of tradition and the centuries during which their lineages have served the [Root.GetStateForm] faithfully.\nSome of our higher officers are now imploring us to open more opportunities for able men to rise in the ranks, while others oppose this vehemently and maintain that there are qualities only blood can assure."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.10.option.a: "We must safeguard the ancient traditions of our officer corps."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.10.option.b: "We can make room for newcomers in the higher parts of the hierarchy."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.11.title: "Esprit de Corps"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.11.desc: "The strain, that the military lifestyle puts the men who serve under, can under good circumstances lead to the development of a spirit of belonging and cooperation that greatly strengthens the armed forces. During the recent conflict with [enemy_country.GetName] we have seen clear signs that our troops are working better together and that they have formed strong bonds of loyalty and duty to the [Root.GetName] [Root.GetStateForm] that would have seemed hard to imagine just a few years ago."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.11.option.a: "This is what separates the [Root.GetAdjective] troops from all other."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.12.title: "Lack of Officers"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.12.desc: "In order to keep a sizable professional army efficient a sufficient number of trained officers are required to carry out the orders and will of the [Root.GetStateForm]. However, the increased demand on quality leadership is not matched by the number of officers on our rolls.\nWith increased demands on quality new officers also take longer to train and are harder to recruit."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.12.option.a: "Shorten the training."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.12.option.b: "Increase recruitment."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.13.title: "Local Militias"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.13.desc: "Many military duties are not performed by the professional armies of the [Root.GetStateForm] but rather by local militias based around the cities, castles and forts in the various parts of our country. These militias often know the local area well and provide very good value for money as garrisons, scouts and gatherers of intelligence but their quality as regular troops are very varied to say the least.\nIt has been suggested that we send professional soldiers to at least instruct all militias in the country and that we rely less on them when conducting operations in many areas. This would, according to our generals, lead to an increase in quality and make us less vulnerable to things we cannot control. It would, however, also most likely mean dismissing a great number of our reserve troops."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.13.option.a: "We need the militias."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.13.option.b: "Let us not rely on local abilities."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.14.title: "Fires of Industry"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.14.desc: "The growing needs of our professional army has had a profound effect on the local business in [Root.GetCapitalName]. The manufactories in and around the city can hardly keep up with rising demand and both investors and workers are now flocking from all over our country to [Root.GetName] to expand the business."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.14.option.a: "The foundries of [Root.GetCapitalName] shall supply the nation!"
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.15.title: "Growth of Regimental Towns"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.15.desc: "As the army becomes a way to earn a livelihood for an increasing number of our subjects, the cities that house the army installations and barracks are starting to grow under the supervision of army engineers and renovators. In [Root.GetName] the growth of [Root.GetCapitalName] has come to benefit the entire province."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.15.option.a: "Great."
 
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.16.title: "Treason against [Root.GetDefiniteArticleBeforePluralCountry][Root.GetName]"
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.16.desc: "Recruitment is out of necessity something that has to be a somewhat decentralized affair. Often it will be entrusted to [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments] in the capital, and then they are responsible to turn up a set number of men in the various provinces under our control.\nThis is a system that to some extent relies on trust as the central government is not involved in the details of countryside mustering, and the only form of control we have are the, often sporadic, inspections the army itself conducts. One such inspection in [cheating_rolls.GetName] has unearthed quite a local scandal. The rolls we have for the area is full of fictional names and nobody seems to know what we could actually muster from the region."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.16.option.a: "This is unfortunate."
 GOT_ARMY_PROFESSIONALISM.16.option.b: "We must punish the perpetrator and conduct our own survey."
