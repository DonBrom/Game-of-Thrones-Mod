 feudal_structure: "Feudal Structure"
 desc_feudal_structure: "Since man first roamed the world, a power structure has existed to keep society from collapsing. The feudal structure, while not the most fair societal system, kept the strongest in power and allowed for certain families to gain a foothold over large swathes of land. Subject lords would be placed in power to maintain the law of the land and ensure order was maintained among the general populace under their rule."

 crop_rotation: "Crop Rotation"
 desc_crop_rotation: "Growing the same crop in the same place for many years in a row, known as monocropping, gradually depletes the soil of certain nutrients and selects for both a highly competitive pest and weed community. Without balancing nutrient use and diversifying pest and weed communities, the productivity of monocultures is highly dependent on external inputs that may be harmful to the soils fertility. Conversely, a well-designed crop rotation can reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and herbicides by better using ecosystem services from a diverse set of crops."
